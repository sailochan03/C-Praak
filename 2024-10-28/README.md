# Q01: Product Calculator

This simple C program multiplies a given `item` by `product` if `item` is nonzero and displays the result. 
Just input a value for `item` when prompted, and the program will print the updated `product`. 

# Q02: Absolute Difference Calculator

This program calculates and displays the absolute difference between two floating-point numbers `x` and `y` without using the `abs` or `fabs` functions.
The program takes two inputs, `x` and `y`. It then uses a conditional check to calculate the absolute difference, storing it in `y`. The absolute difference is determined by:
- `x - y` if `x` is greater than `y`
- `y - x` otherwise
The result is displayed with two decimal precision.

# Q03: Number Categorizer

This program categorizes a given floating-point number `x` as positive, negative, or zero and tracks these categories through `plusSum`, `minusSum`, and `zeroCount`.
- `plusSum`: Stores the sum of positive numbers.
- `minusSum`: Stores the sum of negative numbers.
- `zeroCount`: Counts the instances of zero input.
- If `x` is 0, it increments `zeroCount`.
- If `x` is positive, it adds `x` to `plusSum`.
- If `x` is negative, it adds `x` to `minusSum`.
